# Book Covers Directory

This folder contains cover images for the books displayed in the library section.

## How to Add a New Book

1. **Add the book data to `books.js`**:
   - Open the `books.js` file in the root directory
   - Add a new book object to the `books` array
   - Follow the existing structure for consistency

2. **Add the cover image** (optional):
   - Add your book cover image to this `book-covers` folder
   - Recommended format: JPG or PNG
   - Recommended size: 400x600 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
   - Name the file to match what you specified in `coverImage` property

3. **Image naming convention**:
   - Use lowercase letters
   - Replace spaces with hyphens
   - Keep it short and descriptive
   - Example: `zero-to-one.jpg`, `meditations.jpg`

## If You Don't Have a Cover Image

No problem! The library will automatically use:
1. The `coverEmoji` as a fallback
2. The `coverGradient` for a colorful background

## Tips for Good Cover Images

- Use high-quality images (at least 400px wide)
- Ensure good contrast for readability
- Compress images for web (use tools like TinyPNG)
- Keep file sizes under 200KB when possible
